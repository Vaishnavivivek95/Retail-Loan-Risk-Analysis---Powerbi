📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset of loan applicants to understand the key factors influencing loan approval decisions and to build a robust performance dashboard. 

The primary goal is to provide a clear, visual summary of the loan portfolio's health, identify high-risk/high-reward applicant segments, and assess the predictive power of various financial and demographic features

Built in Power BI, it enables lenders to monitor lending behavior, and support risk-informed decision-making.

•	Higher dependency counts reduce approval rates

•	Lower income groups show signs of over-leveraging

•	Loan-to-credit (LTC) ratio effectively flags high-risk exposures
